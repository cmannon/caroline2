We love working with folks that have big ideas, even when they have limited resources and a tight deadline to make them happen.

					Wireframe is a semester-long program that teaches the basics of web design through hands-on projects and personal mentorship. Daniel Willson, UVA alum and founding leader of HackCville, teaches the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript through small website-building challenges. Students also learn about the various online resources and tools that can help them independently continue their learning after the program is over. Graduates walk away with practical skills, a small portfolio of work, and support from HackCville's wide network of alumni and company partners to help them find internships, full-time, or freelance work.
